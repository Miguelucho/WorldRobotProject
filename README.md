# Localization Project
The project presented in this repository focused on creating a robot model with the unified robot description format
(URDF). The robot model has a base, two wheels as actuators, a laser sensor and a camera. Said robot is placed in a Gazebo
simulation environment with a training map and is asked to go to a goal. 
The standard ROS navigation stack and a Monte Carlo installation package are the robots for the robot that are on the map, that is, the robot is searched for where it is. Additionally, the Rviz program is used to know the readings of the sensors and how the robot interprets its surroundings.
